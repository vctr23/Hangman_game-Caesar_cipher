# Hangman_game-Caesar_cipher

A github repository to upload my work on python of a Hangman game and also a Caesar Cypher, with Tkinter and a LocalHost Flask app

~~You need to run "API.py" first in order for "Principal.py" to work~~

## Changelog
V1.1 -> Changed main on class API to a function ("iniciar_aplicacion") that runs the flask app. This is routed to a process in "Principal.py". Now you don't have to run both scripts at the same time.

V1.2 -> Moved Root window to a diferent file to make "Pricipal.py" a little bit more readable. Changed root window, now uses customtkinter (tkinter is still used for some features).
